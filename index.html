        <h1>About</h1>

With a background in management, sales, customer service, language, and psychology, I bring a diverse and unique set of skills and experiences to any team. Being born in Germany, raised in rural PNW, and having lived  in Japan, I further encompass a global individual with an eclectic combination of cultural and ideological foundations.</p>

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>I graduated <em>magna cum laude</em> from Pacific University in 2015 with a Bachelors of Science in Psychology and Japanese. During my collegiate career, I embedded myself in organizations and activities all around campus. I was a content-reader and submission manager for Pacific Universityâ€™s literary magazine Silk Road. All four years I worked closely with Dr. Connor Principe and his research as both volunteer and paid intern. Furthermore, I was employed by the campus Wellness Center as a community liaison to host events, raise awareness, and spread public health information.</p>
        <p>My crowning achievement at Pacific University was my senior thesis regarding cultural and racial differences in facial perception. I was the only student in my year (and the first in many years) to receive a grant for my thesis allowing me to conduct my research internationally in Japan as well as locally on campus.</p>
        <p>After graduation I put my language and interpersonal skills to use as the Director of Accounts Management at Hi-5 Access, a nationally operating Deaf-Owned American Sign Language Interpreting Agency based in Vancouver, WA. While managing a sales team, my clients included colleges and universities all across the nation, entertainment venues, concert series, and numerous other public and private events.</p>

        <h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I have a passion for literature and am a hobbyist writer. My favorite authors are Gene Wolfe, H.P. Lovecraft, Brandon Sanderson, and Charles Stross. My current favorite book is <span class="book-title">The Fifth Head of Cerberus</span> by Gene Wolfe. I also greatly enjoy modern Korean cinema and older Japanese films, such as Thirst (2009) and Harakiri (1962). </p> 
        <p>I am often learning new skills in my free time, and enjoy being social or spending time outdoors. An ideal Friday night would be to go out with a few close friends for food and drinks while we discuss literature, film, and software development.
