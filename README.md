## Known Bugs

_When scrolled all the way down, the cards under "Notable Projects" will superceed the banner at the top of the page, and display over the banner. The hyperlink for the "API Controller" project is currently null, as Visual Studio 2019 had a fatal error when I was attempting to instal a github extension._
